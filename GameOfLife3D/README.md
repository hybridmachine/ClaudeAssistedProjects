# GameOfLife3D Requirements

## 1. Overview
A 3D visualization of Conway's Game of Life where multiple generations are stacked vertically in 3D space, allowing users to explore the evolution of patterns through time as a three-dimensional structure.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Platform & Compatibility
- **Browser-based**: Runs entirely in the browser with no plugins or additional software
- **Browser Support**: Firefox, Chrome, and Edge (versions from 2022 or newer)
- **Performance**: Real-time rendering at minimum 30 FPS for up to 100 rendered generations
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, WebGL (via Three.js recommended), HTML5, CSS3

### 2.2 Rendering & Visualization
- **Grid Layout**: 
  - Generations rendered in X-Y plane
  - Each successive generation at Z = generation_number (e.g., gen 0 at z=0, gen 1 at z=1)
- **Cell Representation**:
  - Live cells: Colored matte surface cubes
  - Dead cells: Not rendered (empty space)
  - Cell spacing: Configurable padding 0-100% (default 20%)
  - Padding creates visual gap between adjacent cells
- **Lighting**:
  - 80% ambient light (even illumination)
  - 20% directional light (subtle shadows/depth)
- **Background**: 
  - Starfield using actual astronomical star catalog data
  - Static background (not affected by camera movement)

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Data Input/Output
- **Pattern Loading**:
  - Load starting patterns from text files (RLE format recommended)
  - Built-in pattern library (minimum 5 classic patterns: Glider, Blinker, Pulsar, Glider Gun, R-pentomino)
  - Grid size specification (suggest default 50x50, max 200x200)
- **Save/Load Sessions**:
  - Export all computed generations to text file
  - Import previously saved generation data
  - File format: JSON with metadata (grid size, generation count, cell states)

### 3.2 User Controls
- **Generation Controls**:
  - Select number of generations to compute (1-1000)
  - Select display range within computed generations (e.g., show only gen 20-40)
  - Play/Pause animation through generations
  - Step forward/backward one generation
- **Camera Controls**:
  - WASD/Arrow keys: Pan camera
  - Q/E: Rotate around Y-axis
  - R/F: Move up/down
  - Mouse drag: Orbit camera
  - Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
  - Reset camera button
- **Visual Controls**:
  - Cell padding slider (0-100%, 1% increments)
  - Cell color picker
  - Grid lines on/off toggle
  - Generation labels on/off

## 4. User Interface Requirements

### 4.1 Layout
- **Control Panel**: Collapsible sidebar with all controls
- **3D Viewport**: Main area for WebGL rendering
- **Status Bar**: Current generation range, FPS, cell count

### 4.2 Controls Organization
- **File Operations**: Load pattern, Save/Load session
- **Simulation**: Generation count, Display range, Play controls
- **Visual**: Padding, Colors, Display options
- **Camera**: Reset button, control hints

## 5. Performance Requirements
- Handle grids up to 200x200 cells
- Render up to 100 generations simultaneously
- Maintain 30+ FPS during camera movement
- Progressive loading for large generation counts

## 6. Additional Considerations

### 6.1 Error Handling
- Invalid file format detection with user-friendly messages
- Grid size validation
- Memory usage warnings for large configurations

### 6.2 Future Enhancements (Not in MVP)
- Multiple rule sets beyond standard Game of Life
- Cell state history visualization (fade older generations)
- Export to 3D model file (STL/OBJ)
- VR support

## 7. Implementation Notes
- Consider using Three.js for WebGL abstraction
- Use InstancedMesh for performance with many cubes
- Implement frustum culling for cells outside camera view
- Use Web Workers for generation computation if needed
