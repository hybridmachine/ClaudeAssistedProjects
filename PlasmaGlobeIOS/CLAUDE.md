# PlasmaGlobeIOS
## Overview
A soothing Plasma Globe simulation that runs on iPhones and iPads. Users can interact with the globe, and have the plasma follow their finger just like a real plasma globe. The globe floats in a slowly moving starfield, with the occosional galaxy in the backgound. The project is written in Swift and should support iPhone 12 and newer devices.
## Design goals
Clean modern Swift code with no duplication. 
Effecient rendering, smooth user experience.
